SkylineJS is a collection of open source libraries for building efficient, secure and scalable Node.js server-side applications. It is a companion toolkit to your framework of choice (e.g., NestJS), solving common tasks every server-side application has to perform such as parsing environment variables, logging, performance monitoring or caching.

# Philosophy

To create a great server-side application, it's not enough to know _how_ to do something - you need to understand _why_. This knowledge is often scatters across blog posts and StackOverflow threads, leading to conflicting guidelines and philosophies. The result? A patchwork of libraries, each with its own API style, implementation pattern, and architectural decisions. It can be a frustrating experience for developers trying to maintain consistency and clarity in their applications.

SkylineJS brings two essential elements to the table:

1. **Education**: an in-depth explanation of why you should do something a certain way.
2. **Code**: provide you with the necessary code to act on the knowledge you just gained.

# Getting started

Depending on what you want to solve:

```sh
npm install @skyline-js/env
npm install @skyline-js/cache
