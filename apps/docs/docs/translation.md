# Translation

Translating things is a task that causes the upmost annoyance to a developer. After all, why do people bother speaking any other language then english? We do not translate code and it works for everyone so why do we have to put up with this layer of indirection for every single string in our application?

While this documentation cannot change the mind and language of your application's users, it can provide you with tools to make translating things less cumbersome.
