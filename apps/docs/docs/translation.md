This page describes the guiding principles of the Skyline translation approach. <br />
The API reference of the `@skyline-js/translate` package can be found here: [@skyline-js/translate](/docs/api-reference/translate)

## Introduction

Translating things is a task that causes the utmost annoyance to a developer. After all, why do people bother speaking any other language then english? We do not have to translate code and it works for everyone so why do we have to put up with this layer of indirection for every single string in our application?

While this documentation cannot change the mind and language of your application's users, it can provide you with tools and implementation patterns to make translating things less cumbersome.
